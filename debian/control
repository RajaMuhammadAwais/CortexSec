Description: CortexSec autonomous CLI multi-agent security assessment framework
 CortexSec is a policy-bounded autonomous CLI framework for authorized real-world
 security assessments. It performs comprehensive non-destructive security testing
 including reconnaissance, attack-surface modeling, vulnerability discovery,
 exploitability reasoning, and professional report generation. Findings are mapped
 to industry standards: OWASP Top 10, CVSS severity scoring, and MITRE ATT&CK
 threat framework. Supports multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google).
 .
 Features:
  * Multi-agent autonomous orchestration
  * OWASP, CVSS, and MITRE ATT&CK compliance
  * Non-destructive security testing with policy boundaries
  * Causal attack graph reasoning
  * Professional technical and executive reporting
  * LLM-agnostic architecture
